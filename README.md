# USBiso

USBiso is a small device for isolating an usb-connection, developed by W.Hückel. It has an USB-input on one side and the output on the other.

For more details please refer to the manual [wUSBiso.pdf](https://1drv.ms/b/c/a13c984302a24415/ERVEogJDmDwggKFhAQAAAAABLNOFyph7wSh2EQe2afBlVg), written by W.Hückel.<br>
One necessity is described in Chapter 2 of the above-mentioned document.
Furthermore the document refers to mount THT-components on PCB, the PCB instead is newer and uses SMD-components.

I use this device to connect my OPENDCC central station and the corresponding loconet-buffer to the PC.
